    AHEM - Ad Hoc Email is a temporary disposable email service. Its <a href="https://www.ahem.email">public website</a> provides a disposable email service for the domain @ahem.email.<br>
    You can send an email to any @ahem.email address and check the AHEM mailbox to retrieve and read the email.

    But AHEM is also installable as an <a href="https://www.ahem.email/blog/post/how-to-set-up-your-own-disposable-email-server">on premise server</a>, serving your own domains.<br>
    Setting up AHEM as your own temporary email service is now ever easier with Docker.<br>
